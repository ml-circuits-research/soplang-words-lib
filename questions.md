# Questions

Written and managed by the worker. The reviewer writes only in `worker-tasks.md`, so
answers arrive there (or from the user). None of these block: the choice taken is
written with each question and in `worker-log.md`. A question is deleted from this file
once the worker is satisfied with the answer; closed ones are listed at the end in one
line each so the history is not lost.

## Q19 — the default order: words left out before assumptions (R9.2, R9.3)

Round 9 item 2 gives the order consistent, referents, lacks, assumptions, words. With
splits (item 3) that order chooses the wrong split of "reserve the pen and order ink":
one frame `reserve pen ink` leaves "ink" out but assumes nothing, while the right split
(`reserve pen` + `order ink`) assumes `qty=1` from a declared default, so it lost.
- (a) Keep the order as given; hosts that split put `words` first with `criteria`.
- (b) `words` before `assumes` (taken): ignoring part of what was said is worse than
  resting on a default the matrix declares.

**Taken: (b)**, in `RANKING`, test `interpret: alternative splits ...`. One line to change
back if the reviewer prefers (a).

## Closed

- Q1 (no access to the PSys2 repository): answered, the material needed is in `compat/psys2/`.
- Q2 (`imports=core` without a `core` module): withdrawn after the task list was rewritten.
- Q3 (`core.test` name clash): answered, renamed to `core.check` with `core.test` kept as an alias when linked.
- Q4 (`world.schema` is now `world.matrix`): accepted; listed under Changes in SPEC.
- Q5 (strictness of literal kinds): accepted as chosen; unknown kinds are reported by `world.schema(type).unknownKinds`.
- Q6 (no default parent in the library; `root=` in a type map): accepted.
- Q7 (one commit for G1 and G2): accepted; one commit per task from here on.
- Q8 (a sixth status, `refused`): kept; the compatibility runner maps it to PSys2's `conflicting`.
- Q9 (`complete=true` decides `no` against `unknown`): accepted; `compat/psys2/mapping.sop` reads it from `closed`.
- Q10 (entities outside the session): accepted; the runner tells an `e.user` wire first, and the one `$e.tom` case is to be checked in G8 and listed as a failure if the wire really is absent.

- Q11 (which replace figure is the target): answered, the cost once compiled; no further tuning of the cold run.
- Q12 (the four "received" cases): answered, `count` stays `missing` and the cases stay listed; the host asks for `received` itself.
- Q13 (what a host action sees between batched tells): answered, lazy propagation accepted with three conditions (every involved tell named, `ctx.flush()` and `{ now: true }`, two tests); done in P3.
- Q14 (namespace separator): answered by the user, `::` (the only sign with no other meaning); used in R7.9.
- Q15 (name of a deny's priority): answered, `priority=` kept.
- Q16 (`expr=`): answered, not in v1.2; revisit only with a rule that still needs more than about 8 calc/check wires after the built-ins.
- Q17 (words): answered, (b) `core.word lang= text= means= of=`; built in R9.1.
- Q18 (roles): answered, (a) no `role=`; `means=type.key` carries it.
