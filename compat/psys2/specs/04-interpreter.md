# 04 — Main interpreter, operations and rendering (rules profile)

Implementation: `src/interpreter/` (browser-safe). This is the JavaScript execution strategy of vision §8, restricted to what the first worlds need. Lean and solver backends plug in later behind the same envelope.

## Working memory
A **session overlay**: the session's wires (entities, facts and events from the dialog, questions, answers) on top of the knowledge bases of the loaded worlds. Indexes: by id, by type (including ancestor types from the legends), by `(type, fullKey, value)`.

## Questions
```
@w5 core.question
    type=kids.arith.holding
    seek=count
    where.owner=$e.tom
    where.item=apple
```
- `type`: the wire type asked about. `seek`: a key of that type (short or full). `where.<key>=v` (repeatable): constraints on keys of `type`. `about=$id`: ask about one specific wire instead of `where`. `mode=value` (default), `mode=exists` (yes/no), `mode=list` (all matching values), `mode=count`.
- Resolution order:
  1. If the sought key is declared `compute=true` and an operation lists it in `outputs`, run the operation(s).
  2. Otherwise **direct lookup**: wires of `type` (or a descendant) matching all `where` constraints and having the sought key. One distinct value → `supported`; several distinct values → `conflicting` (with the alternatives); none → step 3.
  3. Operations whose `outputs` include the key.
  4. Nothing applies → `missing`, with the sought key and its legend `ask` text.
- `mode=exists` returns `yes` (supported), `no` only if the type's world declares the relevant predicate closed (`closed=true` on the type in the legend), otherwise `unknown` (`missing`). Open world is the default (vision §4).
- Every answer is written to the session as
```
@a3 core.answer
    to=$w5
    value=8
    core.status=supported
    core.via=$op.kids.arith.currentCount
    core.from=$w1
    core.from=$w2
```

## Requests
`core.request action=<operation id or action name> arg.<name>=<value>...` runs the operation with `semantics=action` whose id or `action=` matches. Actions may change **session state only** (task lists, reminders, a game score); external effects need explicit capabilities (vision §8) and are out of scope for the fixture worlds.

## Operation declarations (`operations.sop`)
```
@op.kids.arith.currentCount core.operation
    outputs=kids.arith.holding.count
    inputs=kids.arith.holding.owner
    inputs=kids.arith.holding.item
    impl=currentCount
    semantics=query
    doc="The number someone has after applying, in order, every giving, getting, eating and buying event."
```
`semantics` is `query` (reads), `compute` (pure function of its inputs) or `action` (changes session state; then `action=<name>` names it). `impl` names an export of the world's `ops.mjs`.

## Operation implementations (`ops.mjs`)
```js
export function currentCount(ctx, args) {
  // args: { owner: 'e.tom', item: 'apple', question: <wire> }
  return { status: 'supported', value: 8, from: ['w1', 'w2'], assumptions: [] };
}
```
**Result envelope** (vision §14): `{ status, value?, unit?, values?, from?: string[], assumptions?: string[], missing?: string[], alternatives?: any[], note?: string, data?: object }`.
`status` ∈ `supported` · `missing` (evidence or input missing) · `conflicting` · `ambiguous` · `unsupported` (outside what the world can do) · `budget` (limit reached) · `error` (exception; never turned into `false`).

**Refusal reasons.** Every `unsupported` or `error` envelope has `reason` (also written as `core.answer.reason`): `precondition_failed` (right reading, state or limit refuses), `unknown_argument` (an argument names something unknown), `unsupported_operation` (no operation or mode for it), `execution_error` (exception or invalid envelope; a bug). An operation may set `reason` itself; otherwise the interpreter derives it: `error` gives `execution_error`; interpreter-level `unsupported` gives `unsupported_operation`; an operation's `unsupported` gives `unknown_argument` when its note says something is not known ("I do not know ...") and `precondition_failed` otherwise (`reasonOf` in `src/interpreter/index.mjs`).

**`ctx` API** (all that `ops.mjs` may use):
| Member | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ctx.find(type, where?)` | wires of `type` or descendants matching `where` (short or full keys), session and KB |
| `ctx.ordered(type, where?)` | same, sorted by `core.seq` (dialog order); KB facts first |
| `ctx.get(id)` | one wire by id |
| `ctx.val(wire, key)` | decoded value: number for `integer`/`number`, boolean, id string for references, string otherwise |
| `ctx.vals(wire, key)` | all values of a repeatable key |
| `ctx.ask(spec)` | ask the main interpreter a sub-question `{type, seek, where, mode}`; returns an envelope; depth-limited |
| `ctx.emit(sopText)` | add wires to the session (actions only) |
| `ctx.retract(wireId, reason)` | retract a session wire (actions only): it gets `core.status=retracted` and `core.reason`, is excluded from `ctx.find`, `ctx.ordered`, questions and lookups, but stays in session memory (and in `session.memory()`) for the trace; `ctx.get` still returns it. Returns `false` for an unknown or knowledge-base wire |
| `ctx.state` | a plain JSON object persisted with the session, namespaced per world |
| `ctx.ask_text(key)` | the legend question of a key |
| `ctx.name(id)` | display name of an entity |
| `ctx.batch` | `{ index, count }` while a dialog message is executed (index = how many of its commands ran before this one, count = commands in the message), else `null`. An operation that waits for the host (the chess engine) must not wait when `index > 0`: the host cannot answer between two commands of one message, so it settles at once (spec 07, chess) |
| `ctx.effect(name, args)` | queue a client-side effect (actions only); returned by `session.send()` as `effects` (spec 07) |
| `ctx.request(action, args)` | call another world's action operation by action name or operation id (actions only); returns its envelope; its effects carry that world's id; depth-limited. Example: `ctx.request('ui.openTab', { tab: 'editor' })` |
| `ctx.peek(worldId)` | read-only copy of another world's state (`null` when it has none), for help and status worlds |
| `ctx.patterns(worldId)` | `[{ id, kind, priority, examples }]` of a loaded world (read-only) |
| `ctx.lexicon(lexiconId)` | the words of a lexicon, `[]` when unknown |
| `ctx.lang` | the shared dialogue vocabulary, built from the phrase groups and lexicons of `worlds/lang.common` (`makeLang` in `src/interpreter/lang.mjs`, no word list in code): `yesNo(text)` (`'yes'` for `lang.yes` and `lang.assent`, `'no'` for `lang.no`, `lang.decline` and `lang.cancel`, else `null`; "sure thing" yes, "nah" / "not now" / "never mind" no), `unsure(text)`, `cancel(text)`, `stripLead(text)` (drops leading `lang.lead.ask` words: please, can you, tell me), `stripFiller(text)` (leading `lang.filler` words: lol, ok, uhh), `stripConnective(text)` (leading `lang.connective` words: and, also, but), `ordinal(word)` (1..10 from the order of `lex.lang.ordinal`, 1st..nth, `-1` for last / final / latest), `ordinalWord(n)`, `colour(words)` (`lex.lang.colour` plus `lang.shade`), `size(word)`, `position(word)`, `degree(text)`, `splitAdverb(text)`; the raw lists `COLOURS`, `SHADES`, `COMPARATIVES`, `DEGREE_ADVERBS`. Worlds use it instead of their own yes/no and filler regexes; a `core.pattern` reaches the same groups as `[$lang.yes]`, `[$lang.no]`, `[$lang.unsure]` (spec 03 section 2.5). The discourse layer reads the same table (`interp.lang`) |
`ctx.ask` and `ctx.find` already see every loaded world (a world may ask another one); `ctx.state` is only ever the calling world's own state. An `ops.mjs` may also export `initialState()` (seeds `ctx.state` at session start) and `interceptInput(ctx, text)` (spec 06). It may also export `prepare()`, an async, idempotent hook that the dialog layer awaits before it runs the operations of a segment read in that world (a world with a lazily loaded engine, such as `diagram.sketch`, loads it there, so the page does not pay for it at start and the first sentence is not refused). The dry runs of the dialog layer (capability check, name repair: a reading is carried out on a fork before it is accepted) await it too, so a lazily loaded world is never rejected as "still loading" only because it was not used yet (RP5c).

Budgets: max recursion depth 8, max 10,000 wires visited per question, 200 ms per operation call in the server (best effort in the browser).

## Rendering
Templates (`templates.sop`) turn envelopes into English:
```
@tpl.arith.count core.template
    for=kids.arith.holding.count
    text="{owner} has {value} {item:plural}."
@tpl.arith.count.missing core.template
    for=kids.arith.holding.count
    status=missing
    text="I don't know how many {item:plural} {owner} has."
@tpl.arith.ack.holding core.template
    for=ack.kids.arith.holding
    text="OK, {owner} has {count} {item:plural}."
```
- `when` (optional, repeatable, quoted: `when="value=true"`) is a condition on a placeholder, `<name><op><value>` with op one of `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`; numbers compare numerically, other values as text; every `when` of a template must hold (a placeholder without a value fails it). Templates are tried in file order, so one operation can render yes/no or zero/one/many with `when="value=true"`, `when="value=0"`, `when="value>1"` and a last template without `when`.
- `for` is a sought full key, an operation id, `action.<name>`, or `ack.<type>` (acknowledging a statement). `status` defaults to `supported`.
- Placeholders: `{value}`, any `where`/argument/wire key in short form, `{x.name}` drills into a referenced wire, entity references render as their names. Filters: `:plural`, `:singular`, `:cap`, `:a` (a/an: `an` before a vowel letter except for words that start with a consonant sound such as `unicorn`, `university`, `European`, `one-eyed`; `an` also before silent h: `hour`, `honest`, `heir`), `:list` (comma list with "and"), `:number` (number formatting).
- Fallbacks when no template matches: when the envelope has a `note` and its status is `missing` or `unsupported` (not for interpreter-made refusals: reason `unsupported_operation`, and never for `error`, whose notes are technical), the reply is the note itself (so a world does not need a `text="{note}"` template per operation and status); otherwise supported → the value (with unit); missing → `I don't know yet. <ask of the key>`; conflicting → `I have conflicting information: <alternatives>.`; unsupported → `I can't do that yet.`; statement ack → `OK.`
- The renderer never adds facts absent from the envelope (vision §7).
