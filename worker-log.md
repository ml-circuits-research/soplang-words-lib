# Worker log

One entry per task of `worker-tasks.md`. Every number comes from a command written here.
The worker's machine: Node v22.23.4, Linux; clingo 5.8.3 and PySAT (CaDiCaL) installed
through pip, so "without solvers" is simulated as described in S0.

## S0 — housekeeping — done

**1. Solver tests are skipped when the solver is missing.**

Cause: `available()` in `node/solvers.mjs` returned true whenever the command could be
started. `python3 -m clingo --version` and `python3 -c 'import pysat'` start and exit with
status 1 when the module is missing, so the tests ran and failed. It now requires exit
status 0.

Reproduction of the reviewer's result and the check after the fix, with a `python3` that
has no solver modules first on the PATH:

```
mkdir -p /tmp/fakebin
printf '#!/bin/sh\necho "No module named clingo" >&2\nexit 1\n' > /tmp/fakebin/python3
chmod +x /tmp/fakebin/python3
NODEDIR=$(dirname $(which node))
PATH=/tmp/fakebin:$NODEDIR:/usr/bin:/bin node --test                      # sources
SOPWORLD_BUNDLE=1 PATH=/tmp/fakebin:$NODEDIR:/usr/bin:/bin node --test    # built file
```

| State | tests | pass | fail | skipped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| before the fix (df55e3c), sources | 81 | 78 | 3 | 0 |
| after the fix, sources | 81 | 80 | 0 | 1 |
| after the fix, built file | 81 | 80 | 0 | 1 |

The one skipped test is the comparison with CaDiCaL on 40 instances. The two other tests
that failed before loop over the solvers that are available, so they now run with the two
built-in solvers only.

With the solvers installed (`npm test`): 81 pass on the sources, 81 pass on the built file.

**2. `AGENTS.md`** added: the rules of section 0 in five lines.

Deviations: none.

## G1 — type hierarchy — done

Commit: `git log --grep '^G1, G2:'` (one commit for G1 and G2, see Q7).

- `core.type` takes `extends=<type>` (one parent). Without `of=` the wire id is the type
  name, so `@vehicle core.type` and `@t core.type of=vehicle` both work.
- A pattern of type `T` matches wires of `T` and of its descendants: rules, denies,
  `ask`, `holds`, abduction goals, and the grounding of denies for the solvers.
- Slots and identity keys are inherited, the nearest declaration winning. A reference
  slot accepts wires of descendant types. `ofType(T)` includes descendants.
- Indexes follow: a wire is indexed under its type and every ancestor. A change of the
  hierarchy rebuilds the indexes inside the transaction; a refused change restores them.
- Cycles are refused (`schema` violation). Stratification of negation takes the
  hierarchy into account.
- Neutral example and tests: `fleet.vehicle` > `fleet.car`, `fleet.truck`
  (`examples/schema.mjs`, `test/schema.test.mjs`, first four tests). SPEC 3.8.

Not done: several parents per type. One parent keeps "nearest declaration wins"
unambiguous; say if multiple inheritance is wanted.

## G2 — schema vocabulary — done

- **`core.schema.map`** (SPEC 3.9): data that says how wires of another notation
  declare a slot, a type or a module. Fields are read from the foreign wire by `id`,
  `id.prefix`, `id.suffix`, `<attr>` or `<attr>:<value>`. `as=slot` maps owner, key,
  required, many, id, ask, default, enum, min, max, step, kind, type and `value` (kinds
  and `$type` references mixed); `as=type` maps name, extends, closed and `root` (default
  parent); `as=module` maps name and imports.
- **Literal kinds** are a native slot attribute, `kind=` (several are alternatives),
  checked on `tell` and `fill`; `type=` for references, descendants accepted (Q5).
- **Short and qualified key names** are one key in facts, `fill`, patterns and queries.
- **Open namespaces**: `core.` keys were already always allowed; `core.namespace
  prefix=... open=true` declares more.
- **Unknown attributes** of schema wires are kept; `world.schema(type)` returns them
  with the parent, lineage, `closed` and the keys (own and inherited, marked).
- **Unprefixed modules**: a wire mapped `as=module` loads its imports from the library
  with ids unchanged; `core.use world=<name> prefix=false` does the same for a named
  module. A missing import is a `schema` violation.
- `git grep -i psys2 src/` is empty.

G8.1 was done with it, because it is the real-data check of G2:
`compat/psys2/mapping.sop` (three map wires) and `compat/psys2/schema.test.mjs`.

Commands and numbers:

```
node tools/build.mjs
npm test                               # sources, then the built file
node compat/psys2/schema.test.mjs      # prints the compatibility report lines
git grep -i psys2 src/ | wc -l
node tools/bench.mjs                   # three runs
npm run examples
npm run test:browser
```

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test`, sources | 97 tests: 97 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped |
| `npm test`, built file | 97 tests: 97 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped |
| `git grep -i psys2 src/ \| wc -l` | 0 |
| `npm run examples` | exit 0 |
| `npm run test:browser` | all browser checks passed |

New tests: 14 in `test/schema.test.mjs` (neutral fleet example), 2 in
`compat/psys2/schema.test.mjs`.

Compatibility (`node compat/psys2/schema.test.mjs`): the six legends in
`compat/psys2/worlds` load through `mapping.sop` in the order core, kids.common,
kids.arith, kids.shop, kids.tasks, lang.common: 47 types, 209 keys, **0 legends
refused**. The one knowledge base there (kids.shop, 26 wires) loads with **0
violations**; 104 of its 130 key values fall under a declared key and were checked
against its kind (the other 26 are `core.source`).

Before the sample was reduced I had run the same check, with the first (hard-coded)
implementation, on all 24 legends and 7 knowledge bases of the earlier `psys2/`
directory: 0 legends refused, 0 violations in 1,682 knowledge-base wires. That directory
is gone, so this number cannot be reproduced from the repository as it is now.

Cost on the existing benchmarks (`node tools/bench.mjs`, three runs, ms):

| Workload | 0.4 (one run) | run 1 | run 2 | run 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| join, 3000 parents to grandparents | 171 | 138 | 133 | 148 |
| recursion, 14,000 wires | 366 | 295 | 278 | 294 |
| 2000 separate tells | 43 | 64 | 35 | 35 |
| 1000 state changes with replace | 30 | 58 | 50 | 59 |
| six dialogue turns of completion | 139 | 122 | 125 | 135 |

`replace` looks slower (30 ms before, 50 to 59 ms now). I have not found the cause yet;
it is on my list for G7, where every loop gets a budget and a counter.

Deviations:

- **API change**: `world.schema` was the Map of matrix wires; it is now
  `world.matrix`, and `world.schema(type)` is the method the task asks for (Q4).
- **Matrix wires first**: within one `tell`, matrix wires are read before the facts
  whatever their order in the text, so that a fact told together with its schema is
  validated against it.
- **No default parent in the library** (Q6); `root=` in a type map gives one.
- **One commit for G1 and G2** (Q7).
- Seen in the PSys2 `core` legend and left for G6: keys declared with `dynamic=true`
  (prefixes such as `where.<key>` and `arg.<key>`). The general form will be a slot
  whose key is a prefix.
- Open questions: Q3 (`core.test` name clash), Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7.

## G6 — queries with a status, answers as wires — done

Commit: `git log --grep '^G6:'`. New file `src/query.mjs`; SPEC 4.10.

- **`world.query(question, { record, suppose })`**. The question is an object
  `{ type, seek, where, about, mode }`, a question wire of that shape, the `about=` /
  `seek=` wires `next()` produces, a wire id, or SOP Lang text. Returns
  `{ status, value | values, from, via, missing, alternatives, violations, wires }`.
  Statuses: `supported`, `conflicting` (alternatives listed with their sources),
  `missing` (names the open key and its `ask`), `no` / `unknown` for existence,
  `refused` (Q8). Modes: `value`, `list`, `count`, `exists`. `budget` comes with G7.
- **Resolution order**: lookup, supposition, producers, missing.
  - *Supposition* (not in the task text, added because the real questions need it): when
    no wire matches and the constraints are all values, a wire of that type with those
    keys is told in a scratch transaction, the rules run, the value is read, everything
    is undone. A question such as `type=line seek=total where.item=bolt where.qty=8` is
    then answered by the matrix rules, with no function. This is the shape of most
    questions in the PSys2 cases (`type=kids.shop.change seek=amount where.paid=10 ...`).
  - *Producers*: `core.producer of= key= fn=` declares a registered function that
    computes a key when no wire has it.
- **`{ record: true }`** writes the answer as a wire (and the question, if it was not
  one), with status, value, `core.via` and `core.from`.
- **Actions**: `core.action name= fn= required= ask.<arg>=`; `world.act({ action, args })`
  or a request wire runs the function inside one transaction. Outcomes `done`,
  `missing` (required arguments, with their questions), `refused`, `error`,
  `unsupported`; the world is unchanged in all but `done`.
- **Vocabulary** option: the wire types and key names for questions, answers and
  requests are defaults a host can replace.
- **Prefix slots** (`prefix=true`): one slot for every key `<key>.<anything>`.
- `complete=true` on a type (Q9); the kind `any`.
- Found with the PSys2 cases and fixed as a general rule: a reference under a
  bookkeeping key of an open namespace (`core.via=$pattern`, `core.in=$world`) may
  point outside the world; it is neither checked nor a dependency for `retract`.
  Before this, 0 of the 588 PSys2 turns were accepted.

Commands and numbers:

```
node tools/build.mjs
npm test
node compat/psys2/cases.test.mjs     # prints the per-world lines
git grep -i psys2 src/ | wc -l
npm run examples
npm run test:browser
```

| `npm test`, built file | 113 tests: 113 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped |
| `git grep -i psys2 src/ \| wc -l` | 0 |
| `npm run examples` | exit 0 |
| `npm run test:browser` | all browser checks passed |

New tests: 11 in `test/query.test.mjs` (a warehouse, `examples/warehouse.mjs`), 3 in
`compat/psys2/cases.test.mjs`, 1 assertion block added to `test/schema.test.mjs`.

Compatibility (`node compat/psys2/cases.test.mjs`): the non-answer wires of every PSys2
turn, told to a world that holds the legends (one world per session):

| World | Turns accepted |
| --- | --- |
| kids.shop | 146 of 146 |
| kids.tasks | 227 of 227 |
| kids.arith | 211 of 215 |

The four refused turns (`t.arith.n15`, `n40`, `n41`, `n42`) refer to an entity that is
not a wire of the session: `$e.user` in three, `$e.tom` asked about before being
mentioned in one (Q10). This checks that the wires are accepted, not yet that the
answers are right: that is G8.

Deviations:

- A sixth status, `refused` (Q8). `complete=true` instead of `closed=true` for `no` (Q9).
- `next()` still produces questions with `about=` and `seek=` only; `query` accepts them.
- Not measured: the cost of supposition on a large world (one scratch `tell` per query).

## After the answers to Q3–Q7 — done

Commit: `git log --grep '^core.test -> core.check'`. It comes after G6 and not before
it as asked: G6 was already pushed when I read the answers.

- **Q3**: the condition wire is `core.check`. A `core.test` wire that a rule or deny
  links with `if=` still works as a condition (one more version); a `core.test` wire
  that nothing links is an ordinary fact. Sources, examples, tests, SPEC and the
  documentation pages use `core.check`; `induce` writes `core.check`. One test covers
  the alias and the fact case.
- **Q4**: SPEC has a "Changes" section (9) that lists `world.matrix` / `world.schema(type)`
  and the other changes since 0.4.0.
- **Q5**: `world.schema(type).unknownKinds` lists `{ key, kind }` for kinds the library
  does not check.
- Q3 to Q7 removed from `questions.md` (one line each under "Closed"). Open: Q8, Q9, Q10.

On the `replace` benchmark (30 ms in 0.4, 47 to 81 ms at the reviewer, 50 to 59 ms here):
noted, to be found and fixed in G7 as asked.

## G3 — order and state over time — done

Commit: `git log --grep '^G3:'`. New file `src/time.mjs`; SPEC 3.10, 3.11, 3.12.
Neutral example: an account with deposits, withdrawals and audits (`examples/ledger.mjs`,
`examples/time.mjs`).

1. **Sequence.** `core.sequence key=<key>` declares the key that carries a wire's place;
   without it, or for a wire that lacks the key, arrival order (a wire without the key
   takes the place of the last wire that had one). `world.seqOf`, `world.compare`,
   checks `before` and `after`, and the pattern selector `core.select=latest|first`.
   A rule or deny with a selector is re-evaluated in full when the rest is quiet, and a
   firing whose selected wire was overtaken is withdrawn.
2. **Fluents and effects.** `core.fluent of= key=` and
   `core.effect on= fluent= op=add|sub|set|<fn> amount=<event key> | value=<literal>`,
   with the holder named by `for=<event key>` (a reference) or by
   `where.<holder key>=<event key>`. The value on the wire is the last statement plus
   the later effects in sequence order; an unknown start stays unknown; a told value for
   a fluent key of an existing wire is a new statement, not a conflict; an effect that
   breaks `min` / `max` is a `conflict` naming the event. Retract and replace recompute.
3. **As-of.** `world.asOf(at, fn)`, `ask(pattern, { at })`, `query(q, { at })`.

Commands and numbers:

```
node tools/build.mjs
npm test
node tools/bench-time.mjs
node tools/bench.mjs
npm run examples
npm run test:browser
git grep -i psys2 src/ | wc -l
```

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test`, sources | 124 tests: 124 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped |
| `npm test`, built file | 124 tests: 124 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped |
| `npm run examples` | exit 0 (nine examples now, `examples/time.mjs` added) |
| `npm run test:browser` | all browser checks passed |
| `git grep -i psys2 src/ \| wc -l` | 0 |

New tests: 10 in `test/time.test.mjs`.

Cost (`node tools/bench-time.mjs`, one run):

| Workload | Time |
| --- | --- |
| 200 events on one account, told one by one | 11 ms |
| 1000 events on one account | 64 ms |
| 2000 events on one account | 100 ms |
| retract one event among 2000 | 5 ms |
| query as of the middle of 2000 events | 14 ms |
| 1000 accounts with 2 events each (3000 wires) | 77 ms |

The first version replayed the whole line of a holder for every event: 2000 events
took 2619 ms. A new event that comes last in sequence is now applied to the current
value directly. The last test of `test/time.test.mjs` compares the two paths on 300
generated events over two accounts (same state and same provenance, also after retracting
three events and after a JSON round trip). Writing it showed that the two paths listed
different events under `from` when an event changed nothing; the rule is now one for
both: `from` holds the events that changed the value since it was last set.

The existing benchmarks after G3 (`node tools/bench.mjs`, one run, ms): join 148,
recursion 275, 2000 tells 52, 1000 replaces 47, six completion turns 133.

Deviations and limits:

- `at` for as-of is a number of the declared sequence key, or an arrival number from
  `seqOf`. There is no separate clock.
- As-of sets aside every told wire after the point and re-derives; its cost grows with
  what came later, not with the size of the world.
- Selectors group by the patterns written before them in the rule: put the pattern that
  names the group first (`?s sensor`, then `?r reading of=$s core.select=latest`).
  A selector as the first pattern picks one wire of the whole type.
- Stratification is not checked for selectors as it is for negation.
- A matrix with fluents is treated as non-monotone by the solvers (a refusal is
  attributed to all assigned values, not to a small cause).
- Not yet checked against the PSys2 `kids.arith` dialogues: that is G8.
