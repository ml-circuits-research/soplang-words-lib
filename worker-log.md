# Worker log

One entry per task of `worker-tasks.md`. Every number comes from a command written here.
The worker's machine: Node v22.23.4, Linux; clingo 5.8.3 and PySAT (CaDiCaL) installed
through pip, so "without solvers" is simulated as described in S0.

## S0 — housekeeping — done

**1. Solver tests are skipped when the solver is missing.**

Cause: `available()` in `node/solvers.mjs` returned true whenever the command could be
started. `python3 -m clingo --version` and `python3 -c 'import pysat'` start and exit with
status 1 when the module is missing, so the tests ran and failed. It now requires exit
status 0.

Reproduction of the reviewer's result and the check after the fix, with a `python3` that
has no solver modules first on the PATH:

```
mkdir -p /tmp/fakebin
printf '#!/bin/sh\necho "No module named clingo" >&2\nexit 1\n' > /tmp/fakebin/python3
chmod +x /tmp/fakebin/python3
NODEDIR=$(dirname $(which node))
PATH=/tmp/fakebin:$NODEDIR:/usr/bin:/bin node --test                      # sources
SOPWORLD_BUNDLE=1 PATH=/tmp/fakebin:$NODEDIR:/usr/bin:/bin node --test    # built file
```

| State | tests | pass | fail | skipped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| before the fix (df55e3c), sources | 81 | 78 | 3 | 0 |
| after the fix, sources | 81 | 80 | 0 | 1 |
| after the fix, built file | 81 | 80 | 0 | 1 |

The one skipped test is the comparison with CaDiCaL on 40 instances. The two other tests
that failed before loop over the solvers that are available, so they now run with the two
built-in solvers only.

With the solvers installed (`npm test`): 81 pass on the sources, 81 pass on the built file.

**2. `AGENTS.md`** added: the rules of section 0 in five lines.

Deviations: none.

## G1 — type hierarchy — done

Commit: `git log --grep '^G1, G2:'` (one commit for G1 and G2, see Q7).

- `core.type` takes `extends=<type>` (one parent). Without `of=` the wire id is the type
  name, so `@vehicle core.type` and `@t core.type of=vehicle` both work.
- A pattern of type `T` matches wires of `T` and of its descendants: rules, denies,
  `ask`, `holds`, abduction goals, and the grounding of denies for the solvers.
- Slots and identity keys are inherited, the nearest declaration winning. A reference
  slot accepts wires of descendant types. `ofType(T)` includes descendants.
- Indexes follow: a wire is indexed under its type and every ancestor. A change of the
  hierarchy rebuilds the indexes inside the transaction; a refused change restores them.
- Cycles are refused (`schema` violation). Stratification of negation takes the
  hierarchy into account.
- Neutral example and tests: `fleet.vehicle` > `fleet.car`, `fleet.truck`
  (`examples/schema.mjs`, `test/schema.test.mjs`, first four tests). SPEC 3.8.

Not done: several parents per type. One parent keeps "nearest declaration wins"
unambiguous; say if multiple inheritance is wanted.

## G2 — schema vocabulary — done

- **`core.schema.map`** (SPEC 3.9): data that says how wires of another notation
  declare a slot, a type or a module. Fields are read from the foreign wire by `id`,
  `id.prefix`, `id.suffix`, `<attr>` or `<attr>:<value>`. `as=slot` maps owner, key,
  required, many, id, ask, default, enum, min, max, step, kind, type and `value` (kinds
  and `$type` references mixed); `as=type` maps name, extends, closed and `root` (default
  parent); `as=module` maps name and imports.
- **Literal kinds** are a native slot attribute, `kind=` (several are alternatives),
  checked on `tell` and `fill`; `type=` for references, descendants accepted (Q5).
- **Short and qualified key names** are one key in facts, `fill`, patterns and queries.
- **Open namespaces**: `core.` keys were already always allowed; `core.namespace
  prefix=... open=true` declares more.
- **Unknown attributes** of schema wires are kept; `world.schema(type)` returns them
  with the parent, lineage, `closed` and the keys (own and inherited, marked).
- **Unprefixed modules**: a wire mapped `as=module` loads its imports from the library
  with ids unchanged; `core.use world=<name> prefix=false` does the same for a named
  module. A missing import is a `schema` violation.
- `git grep -i psys2 src/` is empty.

G8.1 was done with it, because it is the real-data check of G2:
`compat/psys2/mapping.sop` (three map wires) and `compat/psys2/schema.test.mjs`.

Commands and numbers:

```
node tools/build.mjs
npm test                               # sources, then the built file
node compat/psys2/schema.test.mjs      # prints the compatibility report lines
git grep -i psys2 src/ | wc -l
node tools/bench.mjs                   # three runs
npm run examples
npm run test:browser
```

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test`, sources | 97 tests: 97 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped |
| `npm test`, built file | 97 tests: 97 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped |
| `git grep -i psys2 src/ \| wc -l` | 0 |
| `npm run examples` | exit 0 |
| `npm run test:browser` | all browser checks passed |

New tests: 14 in `test/schema.test.mjs` (neutral fleet example), 2 in
`compat/psys2/schema.test.mjs`.

Compatibility (`node compat/psys2/schema.test.mjs`): the six legends in
`compat/psys2/worlds` load through `mapping.sop` in the order core, kids.common,
kids.arith, kids.shop, kids.tasks, lang.common: 47 types, 209 keys, **0 legends
refused**. The one knowledge base there (kids.shop, 26 wires) loads with **0
violations**; 104 of its 130 key values fall under a declared key and were checked
against its kind (the other 26 are `core.source`).

Before the sample was reduced I had run the same check, with the first (hard-coded)
implementation, on all 24 legends and 7 knowledge bases of the earlier `psys2/`
directory: 0 legends refused, 0 violations in 1,682 knowledge-base wires. That directory
is gone, so this number cannot be reproduced from the repository as it is now.

Cost on the existing benchmarks (`node tools/bench.mjs`, three runs, ms):

| Workload | 0.4 (one run) | run 1 | run 2 | run 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| join, 3000 parents to grandparents | 171 | 138 | 133 | 148 |
| recursion, 14,000 wires | 366 | 295 | 278 | 294 |
| 2000 separate tells | 43 | 64 | 35 | 35 |
| 1000 state changes with replace | 30 | 58 | 50 | 59 |
| six dialogue turns of completion | 139 | 122 | 125 | 135 |

`replace` looks slower (30 ms before, 50 to 59 ms now). I have not found the cause yet;
it is on my list for G7, where every loop gets a budget and a counter.

Deviations:

- **API change**: `world.schema` was the Map of matrix wires; it is now
  `world.matrix`, and `world.schema(type)` is the method the task asks for (Q4).
- **Matrix wires first**: within one `tell`, matrix wires are read before the facts
  whatever their order in the text, so that a fact told together with its schema is
  validated against it.
- **No default parent in the library** (Q6); `root=` in a type map gives one.
- **One commit for G1 and G2** (Q7).
- Seen in the PSys2 `core` legend and left for G6: keys declared with `dynamic=true`
  (prefixes such as `where.<key>` and `arg.<key>`). The general form will be a slot
  whose key is a prefix.
- Open questions: Q3 (`core.test` name clash), Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7.
